    "[FraudFinder](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/fraudfinder) is a series of labs on how to build a real-time fraud detection system on Google Cloud. Throughout the FraudFinder labs, you will learn how to read historical bank transaction data stored in data warehouse, read from a live stream of new transactions, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), do feature engineering, ingest features into a feature store, train a model using feature store, register your model in a model registry, evaluate your model, deploy your model to an endpoint, do real-time inference on your model with feature store, and monitor your model."
